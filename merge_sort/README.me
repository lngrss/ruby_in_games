Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array,
using a recursive merge sort methodology.

##Tips:
1. Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and
again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).

2. It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you donâ€™t quite 
understand what should be going on.
